# Pi configuration (`~/.pi`)

Personal configuration for the [Pi coding agent](https://pi.dev): a custom
theme, three local TypeScript extensions, and a few installed pi packages.

Extensions placed in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/*.ts` are auto-discovered for all
projects and can be hot-reloaded with `/reload`.

## Local extensions

### `pi-autoupdate.ts`

Wraps Pi's own update mechanism so updates can be triggered from inside a
session (by you or by the model).

It delegates to the `pi` CLI rather than calling `npm` directly, because Pi
packages are not global npm installs — they live under `~/.pi/agent/npm/`,
`.pi/npm/`, and `~/.pi/agent/git/…` and are managed by `pi update`.

Command:

- `/update` — update Pi and all packages
- `/update self` — update Pi only
- `/update extensions` — update packages only
- `/update check` — report whether a Pi (self) update is available

Tool (`pi_update`, callable by the model):

- `scope`: `"all"` (default), `"self"`, or `"extensions"`
- `check`: only check the Pi version, don't install
- `confirm`: show a confirmation dialog (default: on in interactive mode)
- `force`: reinstall Pi even if current (only with `scope: "self"`)

Version-pinned npm specs and pinned git refs are skipped automatically by
`pi update`, so the extension does not special-case them.

#### Upstream-publish-bug resilience

Occasionally a package is published to npm with an unresolved `workspace:*`
dependency (a pnpm/yarn monorepo protocol that plain npm cannot resolve). When
that happens, `pi update`'s internal `npm install …@latest` fails with
`EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL`, which aborts the **entire** package update — so one
broken upstream release blocks every other package too.

Before running `pi update`, the extension pre-flights the latest version of
each declared npm package against the public registry. Any package whose latest
version still carries a `workspace:` dependency is treated as "do not update":
the extension updates the remaining packages individually (`pi update
npm:<pkg>`) and skips the broken one, keeping its currently-installed (good)
version. This is self-healing — once the author publishes a fixed version the
pre-flight finds nothing broken and the normal bulk update resumes. The
pre-flight is fail-open (offline / custom-registry / errors never block
updates). It was added after `@xynogen/pix-optimizer@1.1.14` shipped
`"@xynogen/pix-data": "workspace:*"`.

### `stargate-header.ts`

Replaces the startup header with an open Stargate Command console banner
(chevron crown, rounded gate ring with an event-horizon beam, A-frame stand).
Width-adaptive and re-rendered live on theme, model, skill, and extension
changes.

Commands:

- `/header` — toggle between full and quiet mode
- `/refresh-header` — re-scan skills and extensions

### `token-speed.ts`

Custom footer showing context usage with a progress bar, measured generation
speed (tokens/second), the active thinking level, and estimated thinking and
output token counts, with the model and git branch right-aligned.

## Installed packages

Declared in `settings.json` (and/or user settings). See each package upstream
for details:

- `npm:pi-llama-cpp` — local llama.cpp provider integration
- `npm:pi-mcp-adapter` — MCP server adapter
- `npm:pi-web-access` — web access tools

Other packages may be installed at the user level (for example a guard
extension and a memory extension shown in the startup banner).

## Theme

`stargate-sg1` — an amber/orange SGC terminal palette. Selected via
`"theme": "stargate-sg1"` in `settings.json`. The theme file references a
remote `$schema`; VS Code may warn that the schema URL is "untrusted" and skip
download. That is cosmetic and does not affect Pi, which validates themes
itself.

## Settings

Key fields in `agent/settings.json`:

- `defaultProvider` / `defaultModel` — the provider and model used on startup
- `packages` — installed pi packages
- `theme` — active theme name
- `compaction` — context compaction thresholds
- `thinkingBudgets` / `defaultThinkingLevel` — reasoning token budgets per level

## Editor setup

Out of the box, opening this folder in VS Code shows errors such as
`Cannot find module '@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent'`, `Cannot find name
'process'`, and several "implicitly has an 'any' type" warnings.

These are editor-only. Pi loads extensions through
[jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti), which resolves TypeScript and the pi
packages at runtime with its own bundled copies — the extensions run fine
regardless of what the editor reports.

To give the TypeScript language server the types it needs, install the
editor-only dependencies once:

```bash
cd ~/.pi/agent
npm install
```

On Windows:

```bat
cd %USERPROFILE%\.pi\agent
npm install
```

This installs `@types/node` (fixes `process` and `node:*`), the pi packages
(`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, `@earendil-works/pi-tui`,
`@earendil-works/pi-ai`), and `typebox` (aliased to `@sinclair/typebox` so
`import { Type } from "typebox"` resolves). The `tsconfig.json` ties it
together. Once types resolve, the implicit-any errors disappear too, because
the callback parameter types are inferred from the pi API.

These are `devDependencies` and are not used by Pi at runtime. If you prefer not
to add a local `node_modules`, the errors are safe to ignore.

## Updating

Update everything (Pi and packages) from a shell:

```bash
pi update
```

Or from inside a session with the bundled command:

```text
/update
```
