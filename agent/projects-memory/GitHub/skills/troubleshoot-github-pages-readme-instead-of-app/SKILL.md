## When to Use
Use when a GitHub Pages project URL renders the repository README or default Jekyll theme instead of the intended static app/game.

## Procedure
1. Check the repo for a Pages entrypoint: root index.html for branch-root publishing, docs/index.html for branch-docs publishing, or a workflow that uploads an artifact containing index.html.
2. Fetch the live Pages URL and inspect the title/content; GitHub/Jekyll README output usually has the repo name in the title and README headings, while the app has the app title and markup.
3. Inspect .github/workflows for actions/configure-pages, upload-pages-artifact, and deploy-pages. If present, confirm the workflow creates/copies the intended app as index.html in the uploaded artifact.
4. Explain the settings distinction: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source = GitHub Actions for deploy-pages workflows; Source = Deploy from a branch requires index.html in the selected branch/folder.
5. For a robust code-side fix when branch source may remain enabled, add a small root index.html redirecting to the actual app file, or rename/copy the app to index.html if the URL must stay at the root path.
6. After edits, verify every redirect target exists and check git status per repo; tell the user to commit/push and wait for Pages cache/rebuild.

## Pitfalls
- A Pages workflow can exist but not affect the live site if the repo Pages source is still set to Deploy from a branch.
- push triggers that include both main and master may still have a pages job hardcoded to refs/heads/main; check branch conditions when deploying from Actions.
- README-only pushes may be ignored if workflow paths-ignore excludes Markdown, so use a real code/config change or manually rerun the workflow.
- GitHub Pages can cache for several minutes after a push.

## Verification
1. Live URL no longer has the README/Jekyll title and shows or redirects to the intended app.
2. The published source contains an index.html at its root.
3. Git status shows only intended files were changed.
