## When to Use
Use when reviewing or debugging translation quality, dictionary conflicts, or lexicon behavior in this Goa'uld Translator repository.

## Procedure
1. Inspect dictionary/table counts with `wc -l` and a small Python parser over `Goauld-Dictionary.md`, `Goauld-Woerterbuch.md`, `Goauld-Fictionary.md`, and `Goauld-Neologikum.md`.
2. Load `goauld_lexicon.yaml` through `yaml_loader.load_lexicon_yaml()`; remember this merges `goauld_overrides.yaml` when present. Summarize flat entries, DE/EN primary maps, secondary maps, register/tier counts, and top gloss conflicts.
3. Treat `goauld_overrides.yaml` as the curated runtime/language-development overlay. For language expansion work, add reviewed entries there with DE+EN glosses, `review_status`, derivation/morphology, source tier, and examples; do not hard-code runtime vocabulary in `_GAP_FILL`.
4. Keep `GOAULD_GRAMMAR.md` as the grammar specification and `goauld_root_registry.yaml` as the stable root registry. Update both when new productive roots, grammar decisions, or Egyptian-substrate policy changes are introduced.
5. Import `goauld_translator`, call `_load_lexicon()`, instantiate `SearchEngine` and `SentenceAnalyzer`, then test representative sentences such as `Ich bin nicht Jaffa`, `You are a traitor`, `Ich liebe dich`, `human slave`, `wer/what/where`, and modal cases like `Ich muss hören`.
6. Check whether YAML mode bypasses `_load_mds()` and `_GAP_FILL`; if a lookup fix is needed, put it in `goauld_overrides.yaml` or the base YAML, not only in the MD fallback path.
7. For implemented translation-quality or language-expansion changes, update `tests/golden_translations.yaml` and run `python validate_translation_quality.py`, `python -m pytest -q tests`, `python -m ruff check .`, and `python -m mypy goauld_translator.py yaml_loader.py validate_translation_quality.py tests/test_translation_quality.py`.
8. If a `plans/*.md` implementation plan is completed and the user explicitly asked for deletion after implementation, delete that plan only after all validation commands pass.
## Pitfalls
- Do not judge translation quality only from interactive fuzzy search; sentence translation needs stricter exact phrase and grammar behavior.
- Do not add the full Ancient Egyptian dictionary as direct runtime vocabulary; use curated substrate roots with low priority instead.
- Do not store temporary audit progress in memory; only durable repo facts such as source-of-truth behavior should be saved.

## Verification
1. The audit reports dictionary counts, YAML counts, conflict categories, and concrete failing sentence examples.
2. Plans clearly distinguish search behavior from translation behavior and canonical terms from fanon/substrate terms.
3. Any proposed lexicon fix targets the runtime YAML path (`goauld_lexicon.yaml` or `goauld_overrides.yaml`), not only Markdown fallback behavior.
4. Translation-quality implementation is considered validated when `python validate_translation_quality.py`, `python -m pytest -q tests`, `python -m ruff check .`, and the project mypy command all pass.
