## Governance
Explicit task requirements and repository evidence override this skill; use only the portion relevant to the current change and treat historical versions, counts, and paths as evidence to re-check.

This skill describes the HISTORICAL Borealis Signal browser implementation. The canonical active project is now Vesper Signal under `L:/LAB/Half-Life 3/game` (Godot); root Start-Game launches that project, not historical dist/. For active Godot work use the project skill `work-on-vesper-signal-godot` and current game/docs. Browser/npm/Playwright gates below do not accept Godot changes.
## When to Use
Use for the Borealis Signal rendering, weapon/audio, mountain-level, physics, or matching smoke-test path. Select only the section corresponding to the requested change.

## Rendering pipeline
Quality is controlled by `Renderer.setVideoProfile(quality)`.
- `PostFX.ts`: `RenderPass → GTAOPass → UnrealBloomPass → Vignette ShaderPass → FXAA ShaderPass → OutputPass`. `OutputPass` stays last.
- `PostFX.render()` returns `false` when disabled so low quality falls back to direct rendering.
- EnvMap is baked once with `PMREMGenerator` + `RoomEnvironment`; low quality clears it.
- `DecalSystem` caps at 32 recycled decals; keep the cap.

## Weapon and Gravity Gun rules
- `WeaponKey = 'pistol' | 'smg' | 'gravityTool'`; Gravity Gun is slot 3. Digit1/2/3 select, Q cycles.
- Left mouse grabs/holds, right mouse throws; `throwLocked` requires release+re-press.
- HUD shows infinity ammo for gravity tool; `weaponChanged` accepts `gravityTool`.

## Audio rules
- Every one-shot Web Audio chain must disconnect all source/oscillator and gain nodes on `onended`.
- Combine fire emits `weapon.smg.fire` only when the 0.75s attack cooldown actually produces a shot.
- `DeathAnnouncer` edge-triggers the death message once per death; never emit death messages per frame.
- Regression gate: `npm run test:audio`.

## Expanded mountain-level architecture
- Baseline floor is 38×52 = 1,976 m². The current map totals 70,706 m²: 1,976 m² lab + 1,130 m² interior floors + 260×260 = 67,600 m² exterior terrain.
- Progression: preserved reactor lab → equipment storage → generator cavern → frozen overflow → mountain exterior → ridge checkpoint.
- `LevelDefinition.bounds` owns X/Z player clamps. Do not restore hard-coded old bounds.
- Geometry `role: 'ground'` participates in Rapier grounding but not lateral Player AABB collision; `role: 'solid'` participates in both.
- `InteriorBuilder.expandCorridors` is the source of floor/wall/ceiling geometry for corridor segments.
- `TerrainMath.terrainHeight` is the single deterministic height source. `Terrain.ts` feeds the same vertices and explicit `Uint32Array` indices to the visible mesh and Rapier trimesh.
- Exterior entities use `terrainGroundY`; dominant ruin walls have both Player and Rapier collision.
- Keep exterior decoration instanced and shadow budgets bounded; do not replace the terrain with thousands of box colliders.
- The tunnel mouth at z=-116 must blend to baseHeight. Exit trigger Y must contain `terrainHeight + 1.72`.

## Pitfalls
- Live settings apply only in-game; before `bootstrap()` the active renderer/audio may be undefined.
- Run `tools/extract_hl2_textures.py` from repo root. Never commit generated `public/assets/legacy_hl2/*`, `public/assets/pbr/`, or `public/assets/rtx/`.
- Headless verification uses system Chrome (`channel: 'chrome'`).
- Keep the Rapier/renderer loop single-RAF and clamp accumulated deltas.
- Do not validate a changed build against a stale preview server. Start a preview on a separate free port and pass `SMOKE_URL`.
- Never kill all `node.exe` processes to restart Vite; stop only the process owning the chosen preview port.
- The exterior smoke must not fire the SMG from spawn or it empties before the exterior ambush; begin firing at the surface.
- The simple enemy AI has no navmesh; keep exterior encounters in the central valley.

## Verification
1. Audio-only changes: run `npm run test:audio`.
2. Level/physics changes: run `npm run test:level` plus a fresh-preview `mountain_smoke.mjs` on a dedicated `SMOKE_URL`.
3. Rendering/build changes: run `npm run build`; add `npm run analyze` only when bundle/performance scope changed.
4. Use `check_404.mjs` when routes/assets changed. Require the mountain smoke to reach only the checkpoints affected by the change and report no console/page errors.
5. Perform the full manual controls, puzzle, interior, terrain/collision, and free-roam smoke only for cross-cutting gameplay/release work.
