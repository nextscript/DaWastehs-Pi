# SandGame — Single-File HTML Simulation Workflow

## Scope
Read `html-golden-rules`, `2d-pixel-engine-golden-rules`, and `simulation-and-system-golden-rules` before broad UI/engine changes.

## Edit workflow
- Inspect `sand_game.html` around the target functions; preserve physics, chemistry, and biology unless explicitly improving correctness.
- Use targeted edits. For simulation changes, watch edge wrapping, update-order bias, active-cell wake-up behavior, and typed-array bounds.
- New grid arrays must be wired through declaration, `resize()` allocation/copy, and `swap()` transfer.

## Dual render path invariant
`render()` dispatches to WebGL2 `renderGL()` when GPU is enabled, otherwise CPU `renderCPU()` with 2D canvas `putImageData`. CPU is the exact-color source of truth.

Any per-cell color logic change must be applied to BOTH:
- `renderCPU()` JavaScript.
- `GL_FS` GLSL fragment shader.

The shader reads packed RGBA8 textures: `t0` material/temp/ph/csLow, `t1` age/health/stage, `t2` csHigh/salinity/rad. Material colors/dynamic flags come from `u_colors[77]` / `u_dyn[77]` generated from `MATS` / `DYNAMIC_COLOR` in `initGL()`.

## GLSL gotchas
- WebGL2 / GLSL ES 3.00 is required for dynamic uniform-array indexing.
- Use `texelFetch` and `*255` to reconstruct integer channels from RGBA8.
- Flip Y in the vertex shader so grid row 0 renders at the top.
- JS `%` on ints maps to GLSL integer `%`; float modulo uses `mod(x, 2.0)`.

## Pitfalls
- Do not remove materials or simplify systems to make optimization easier.
- Dead-code guards hide reactions: if salt/acid/growth "does nothing", inspect enclosing conditions first.
- Newly grown cells must inherit parent plant water/sap state or immediately lose health.
- Node/vm lexical `let`/`const` do not land on the sandbox object; access them in-context.

## Verification
```bash
node validate.cjs
node smoke.cjs
```

`validate.cjs` extracts the script and syntax-checks it. `smoke.cjs` runs a mocked DOM/canvas/WebGL2 VM, calls `init()` and 30 simulation/render ticks, and exercises both GPU and CPU render paths. It catches runtime errors but not pixel-perfect shader fidelity; still review the visual diff manually when color logic changes.
